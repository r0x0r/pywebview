Thanks for considering contributing to pywebview.

Pywebview is a small-time project, which gets updated sporadically whenever time permits. Any help is more than appreciated and the best way to contribute is submitting a pull request. Bug fixes are always welcome. If you wish to submit a new feature, please create an issue and discuss it beforehand. Commits, not comments.

If you found a bug and want to report it, please test it first in a web-browser that is used by default for your operating system to see if the problem is with your code, rather than pywebview. Do not forget to specify on which platform and pywebview version it occurs.

Hard cold cash is appreciated as well.
