_pywebview_ is a lightweight BSD-licensed cross-platform wrapper around a webview component. _pywebview_ allows to display HTML content in its own native GUI window. It gives you power of web technologies in your desktop application, hiding the fact that GUI is browser based. _pywebview_ ships with a built-in HTTP server, DOM support in Python and window management functionality.

Get started by [installing _pywebview_](/guide/installation), explore [documentation](/guide/) or [examples](/examples/). If React is your thing, get started right away with [React boilerplate](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview-react-boilerplate).
