# Bug reporting

If you think you found a bug, verify following steps first

1. Does the bug occur in a default browser? If so, the problem is with your code, not pywebview
2. Are you using the latest master? Bug fixes are merged into the master and it may take a while until a new release is deployed to Pypi.
3. Has it been [reported](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview/issues) already?

If you verified all the three points and are sure that the issue is caused by pywebview, feel free to submit a new issue. Please remember to specify under which operating system the bug occurs, as well as with other relevant information. In case of Linux, specify a distro you are using.
